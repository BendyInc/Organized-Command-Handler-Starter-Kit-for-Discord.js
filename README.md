***I don't recommend hosting this on Glitch, unless it's just my PC bugging.***

This is a starter kit for organized discord bots! To add a command, simply create a file. Name it something like 'ping.js'.
Now, anytime you say '{prefixinconfigjson}ping', the bot responds with pong!
Take a look at the example command in the folder named 'examples'.
I recommend duplciating it and putting the duplicate in the commands folder, then modifying it from there.

That's all there is to it!

*As I said, this project is bugged and I'm pretty sure Glitch blocked discord.js.*
